This method models a given flow field as a superposition\\nof simple harmonic oscillators, and is trained to classify patterns of the turbulent features of the flow\\nfield. Lifetime of the detected features is then predicted using a non-linear regression model.

It translates the real-time altimetric data provided by NASA satellites into flow\\nfields and then analyze them using Lagrangian algorithms. A grid of tracer particles is initialized over\\nthe domain of interest. The flow map is then approximated by integrating particle trajectories. The\\ndispersion of these trajectories shed light on the flow characteristics.

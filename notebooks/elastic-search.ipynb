An MDP is defined by four parameters in the tuple <img className=\\'latex-svg\\' src=\\'http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/%5C%5Cbig+%5C%5Clangle+S%2C+A%2C+T%2C+R+%5C%5Cbig+%5C%5Crangle.svg\\' alt=\\'\\\\big \\\\langle S, A, T, R \\\\big \\\\rangle\\' />.  These variables are the states, actions, transition function, and reward function, described previously.</p>\\n<p>An MDP assumes that the state of the world is completely observable to an agent.  This is true in many games, like Chess.  While players cannot directly observe each other\\'s minds and what strategies their opponent might use, the location of every piece is common knowledge to both players.  In this way, the state is <em>fully</em> observable.</p>\\n<p>Yet in many situations, the state is not fully observable.  We can generalize the concept of an MDP to a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process or POMDP, and extend the same ideas to a more general class of environments in which an agent cannot directly observe the full state.</p>\\n<p>A simple example of a partially observable environment is Texas Hold \\'em Poker.  Remember that the true state includes every detail of the game - who has what cards in their hand as well as the order of the cards in the draw pile.  Each player can observe their own hand, but not the hand of their opponents.  Similarly, no players can observe the draw deck, but as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_card_poker\">community cards</a> are drawn and placed on the table, all players can view them.</p>\\n<p>The same idea generalizes to more real-world problems as well.  When you negotiate the purchase of a house, both the seller and the buyer have private information.  A smart (often legally required) step in the process is getting inspections and appraisals.  From the buyer\\'s perspective, these services are useful in that they reduce uncertainty about the home.</p>\\n<p>One problem a homeowner would like to avoid is termites.  A smart buyer can learn some of the visual signs of termite infestation/damage by doing a few basic Google Image Searches.  Those images will equip most buyers to notice obvious signs of termites, but not necessarily train their eye to be keen of all damages.  Perhaps the table below might describe how well a random person can detect a termite infestation.</p>\\n<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr>\\n<th></th>\\n<th align=\"center\">Found Evidence</th>\\n<th align=\"center\">Found No Evidence</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Has Termites</td>\\n<td align=\"center\">65%</td>\\n<td align=\"center\">45%</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>No Termites</td>\\n<td align=\"center\">10%</td>\\n<td align=\"center\">90%</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n<p>The rows represent ground truth.  The columns specify whether or not the prospective buyer believes they found evidence of termites.  When termites are present, the buyer is just a bit better than chance at discovering the evidence, doing so correctly 65% of the time.  Note that this has nothing to do with how likely a home is, in general, to have termites.  Simply that <em>given</em> that it does, the buyer has a limited ability to notice.</p>\\n<p>For the case of no termites present, the buyer makes a false positive 10% of the time.</p>\\n<p>Given these weak changes of discovering the truth, a buyer should really consult a professional.  [ Get your name here by contacting advertising@dataskeptic.com if you\\'re such a professional :) ]</p>\\n<p>Presumably, the trained inspector has a better observation function like the one below.</p>\\n<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr>\\n<th></th>\\n<th align=\"center\">Found Evidence</th>\\n<th align=\"center\">Found No Evidence</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Has Termites</td>\\n<td align=\"center\">98%</td>\\n<td align=\"center\">2%</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>No Termites</td>\\n<td align=\"center\">5%</td>\\n<td align=\"center\">95%</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n<p>Thus, the buyer should very much like to consult with the inspector on this matter.  Yet, contracting the inspector does not give access to ground truth.  It simply generates a report which we shall call an Observation.  In POMDPs, <img className=\\'latex-svg\\' src=\\'http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/%5C%5COmega.svg\\' alt=\\'\\\\Omega\\' /> is the set of all possible observations.  In our termite example, that would be <img className=\\'latex-svg\\' src=\\'http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/PassedInspection.svg\\' alt=\\'PassedInspection\\' /> and <img className=\\'latex-svg\\' src=\\'http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/FailedInspection.svg\\' alt=\\'FailedInspection\\' />.  POMDPs also include <img className=\\'latex-svg\\' src=\\'http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/O.svg\\' alt=\\'O\\' />, the observation function.  The observation function takes as input, a particular state, action, and observation, and returns the probability of this combination.  Put simply, if you happen to be in state <img className=\\'latex-svg\\' src=\\'http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/s.svg\\' alt=\\'s\\' /> and you do action <img className=\\'latex-svg\\' src=\\'http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/a.svg\\' alt=\\'a\\' />, what are the odds you will observe <img className=\\'latex-svg\\' src=\\'http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/o.svg\\' alt=\\'o\\' />.  If your house happens to be infested with termites, and you hire an inspector, what is the probability they will find the infestation?  By the table above, 98%.  Defining the observation function more formally, you get <img className=\\'latex-svg\\' src=\\'http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/O+%253A+S%2C+A%2C+%5C%5COmega%2C+%5C%5Crightarrow+%5B0%2C1%5D.svg\\' alt=\\'O : S, A, \\\\Omega, \\\\rightarrow [0,1]\\' />.</p>\\n<p>The observation function captures imperfections in the sensors available to an agent.  Those sensors can be something as simple as the card you\\'ve got in your hand or as complex as all our visual and auditory senses.</p>\\n<p>In order to do anything useful with a POMDP, you have to <em>know</em> this function.  In other words, for a home buyer to use a POMDP to do optimal decision making, they would need to know the reliability of the inspector as shown in the table above.  Although this is a criticism highlighting the limits of the formalism\\'s robustness, this limitation still permits a vast set of interesting problems where POMDPs are applicable.  Further, the methodology could perhaps be extended to learn this function.</p>\\n<p>So we now add <img className=\\'latex-svg\\' src=\\'http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/O.svg\\' alt=\\'O\\' /> and <img className=\\'latex-svg\\' src=\\'http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/%5C%5COmega.svg\\' alt=\\'\\\\Omega\\' /> to the tuple giving us the formal definition of a POMDP:</p>\\n<p><img className=\\'latex-svg\\' src=\\'http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/%5C%5Cbig+%5C%5Clangle+S%2C+A%2C+T%2C+R%2C+%5C%5COmega%2C+O%2C+%5C%5Cdelta+%5C%5Cbig+%5C%5Crangle.svg\\' alt=\\'\\\\big \\\\langle S, A, T, R, \\\\Omega, O, \\\\delta \\\\big \\\\rangle\\' /></p>\\n<p>I snuck in an extra variable called <img className=\\'latex-svg\\' src=\\'http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/%5C%5Cdelta.svg\\' alt=\\'\\\\delta\\' />.  This is the discount factor.  It should also be there in the MDP definition, but our previous episode and blog entry left it out for simplicity.  This is a value in the range <img className=\\'latex-svg\\' src=\\'http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/%5B0%2C+1%5D.svg\\' alt=\\'[0, 1]\\' /> which specifies how to value further expected rewards.  In other words, a dollar today is better than a dollar tomorrow.  But is it better than a two dollars tomorrow?  Probably not.  What\\'s the minimum tomorrow value to be worth waiting for?  Depends on your discount factor <img className=\\'latex-svg\\' src=\\'http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/%5C%5Cdelta.svg\\' alt=\\'\\\\delta\\' />.</p>\\n<p>We need to generalize our definition of the transition function <img className=\\'latex-svg\\' src=\\'http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/T.svg\\' alt=\\'T\\' /> from the original MDP definition.  In that definition, we had a probability distribution over the next state based on the current state.  The observation that we will get in the partially observable world is going to inform this function.  The POMDP definition is <img className=\\'latex-svg\\' src=\\'http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/T%253A+S_t%2C+A_t%2C+O_t%2C+S_%7Bt%252B1%7D+%5C%5Crightarrow+%5B0%2C+1%5D.svg\\' alt=\\'T: S_t, A_t, O_t, S_{t+1} \\\\rightarrow [0, 1]\\' />.  In the vernacular: given a particular state, action taken in that state, and observation made while taking that action (all this at time <img className=\\'latex-svg\\' src=\\'http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/t.svg\\' alt=\\'t\\' />), what\\'s the probability of going into a particular next state (at <img className=\\'latex-svg\\' src=\\'http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/t%252B1.svg\\' alt=\\'t+1\\' />)?</p>\\n<p>This tuple is the definition of the POMDP.  It\\'s nice in that it provides a formal, well defined framework which can be used to describe a wide variety of problems in a common language.  Just about any situation you can think of can be expressed in the form of a POMDP.  Although it\\'s not done much, nothing is stopping us from using this idea to analyze the differences and properties of stochastic games in a manner analogous to the way a computational theorist studies the properties of classes of algorithms.  Yet, POMDPs are not widely thought of as abstract tools in this way.  There mostly thought of as <em>tools</em> for solving problems.</p>\\n<p>The algorithms for solving POMDPs are known.  Implementations like <a href=\"http://www.pomdp.org/code/index.html\">pomdp-solve</a> exist.  If you can specify your problem in the form of a POMDP and provide it as input to that program, it will return you an <em>optimal</em> solution to your problem!  No programming required.  Just provide some JSON file like this:</p>\\n<p><code><pre>\\n{\\n    \"S\": {\"TERMITES\", \"NO_TERMITES\"},\\n    \"A\": {\"BUY\", \"NO_BUY\"},\\n    \"T\": [...],\\n    \"R\": [...],\\n    \"Omega\": {\"PASS_INSPECTION\", \"FAIL_INSPECTION\"},\\n    \"O\": [...],\\n    \"delta\": 0.752\\n}\\n</pre></code></p>\\n<p>... and that\\'s all there is to it.  Just state your problem, submit it to <code>pomdp-solve</code> and wait.  And wait.  And wait and wait and wait and wait and wait.  Because solving this problem suffers from the <a href=\"https://dataskeptic.com/blog/episodes/2015/the-curse-of-dimensionality\">curse of dimensionality</a>.</p>\\n<p>If we ignore intractability for the moment, we can be certain of finding the optimal behavior to adopt under any circumstance.  When you \"solve\" a POMDP, the result is a policy.  The policy is a finite state machine.  Think about that for a moment, because it\\'s rather remarkable.  A finite state machine has no memory.  It\\'s a rather \"dumb\" thing.  Following the instructions of a finite state machine is a rather mindless behavior.  Yet it\\'s optimal.  Using it is computationally efficient.  There would be no surprises running it in some production system.  Memory needs and computational needs would be trivial to estimate.  If some useful system was managed by a POMDP, that system could be very easily maintained and verified.  This would be ideal for critical systems which simply <em>cannot</em> fail.</p>\\n<p>So the policy that one gets by solving a POMDP comes in a very nice form.  How do we arrive at it?  I won\\'t cover this fully here.  If you\\'re eager to go down this exciting rabbithole, the core answer is using the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman_equation\">Bellman equation</a>.  The best place to go next is <a href=\"http://www.pomdp.org/\">The POMDP Page</a>.  Everybody, get over there.  That site should be Alexa Top 50.  A wealth of good information on POMDPs available for you.</p>',\n",

If you\\'re looking for a bit more on this subject, a great next step is <a href=\"http://www.cassandra.org/arc/talks/aaai2013/index.html\">these slides</a> from Anthony Cassandra.</p>\\n<p>There are 20 slides that present some of the core ideas of POMDPs visually, helping to teach the methods a bit better than our audio format podcast would allow.  A great follow up after these sides would be either the original paper or the applicable chapter in Russell and Norvig\\'s textbook.</p>\\n<p>We took two images from the presentation to create this post\\'s featured image.  There are two parts.</p>\\n<p>The \"flow chart\" is the policy of a solved POMDP.  Specifically, it\\'s the optimal strategy which was discussed on the podcast and summarized as the \"two consistent listens means open\" strategy.  The second image in especially key to understanding how POMDPs are solved, so let\\'s go deeper into an explanation of that image.</p>\\n<p>We first observe our axis and find the x-axis labeled \"Belief State\".  Since there are two states in the Lady and the Tiger Game, <img className=\\'latex-svg\\' src=\\'http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/TigerLeft.svg\\' alt=\\'TigerLeft\\' /> and <img className=\\'latex-svg\\' src=\\'http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/TigerRight.svg\\' alt=\\'TigerRight\\' />, we can summarize our believes with one number: <img className=\\'latex-svg\\' src=\\'http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/Pr%28TigerLeft%29.svg\\' alt=\\'Pr(TigerLeft)\\' /> since <img className=\\'latex-svg\\' src=\\'http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/Pr%28TigerRight%29+%253D+1+-+Pr%28TigerLeft%29.svg\\' alt=\\'Pr(TigerRight) = 1 - Pr(TigerLeft)\\' />.  The visualization we have here <em>only</em> works for simple one-parameter believe spaces.</p>\\n<p>This representation can be generalized to any number of dimensions, depending on the state.  While it\\'s often insightful to view 3D plots for this sort of representation, most non-trivia problems exist in <img className=\\'latex-svg\\' src=\\'http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/n.svg\\' alt=\\'n\\' /> dimensional state spaces with <img className=\\'latex-svg\\' src=\\'http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/n+%253E+3.svg\\' alt=\\'n > 3\\' />, so visualization of the entire belief space is impossible.  Yet, in this simple example, it\\'s quite instructive.</p>\\n<p>In the game described by the plot, the agent has four Actions available to choose from: <img className=\\'latex-svg\\' src=\\'http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/R.svg\\' alt=\\'R\\' />, <img className=\\'latex-svg\\' src=\\'http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/S.svg\\' alt=\\'S\\' />, <img className=\\'latex-svg\\' src=\\'http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/T.svg\\' alt=\\'T\\' />, and <img className=\\'latex-svg\\' src=\\'http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/N.svg\\' alt=\\'N\\' />.  Of course, the can execute any action at any time.  However, a rational agent should reason in the following way: <em>if</em> my beliefs were <img className=\\'latex-svg\\' src=\\'http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/x.svg\\' alt=\\'x\\' />, what would be the expected value I could earn if I executed action <img className=\\'latex-svg\\' src=\\'http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/a_i.svg\\' alt=\\'a_i\\' />.  For example, in the Lady and the Tiger game, a super high degree of belief that the tiger is on the left should intuitively cause the agent to open the opposite door.  By extension, as the belief that the tiger is on the left, at some point, it must become more optimal to take the action of listening.  By further extension, there must be some point at which the agent has become confident enough that the tiger is on the right, and thus, opening the opposite door becomes the best option.</p>\\n<p>Thus, the four lines shown in this plot represent the expected value an agent can earn given their belief state.  Technically, these lines exist over the entire domain from 0 to 1.  However, for brevity / clarity, the creator of this image has trimmed these lines to primarily show the area in which each action is optimal.</p>\\n<p>The optimal action an agent can take is thus given by the maximizing action given their beliefs.  Should their beliefs fall exactly at the intersection of two links, this indicates a complete ambivalence for either strategy, best settled by a coin toss.  Thus, the maximizing line at each point constitutes the value function of the agent.</p>\\n<p>Such a function is labeled \"piecewise linear an convex\".  It\\'s piecewise because of the discontinuities where an agent switches what action they should take.  It\\'s linear because each piece is linear.  It\\'s convex because the optimal piecewise segments meet the mathematical definition of convex.  The properties of convexity can be exploited in these problems.</p>\\n<p>If you\\'re interested in learning more, check out the aforementioned slides:</p>\\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cassandra.org/arc/talks/aaai2013/index.html\">http://www.cassandra.org/arc/talks/aaai2013/index.html</a></p>',\n",

       "     'description': '<p>About VigLink:</p>\\n\\n<p>At VigLink, we believe the future of marketing lies within the untapped potential of digital content covering commercial products across the Web. We empower influential publishers who produce this content to connect enthusiastic consumers with the products they love from the brands who value them the most. We accomplish this directly through publishers’ words, without need for an ad.</p>\\n\\n<p>By identifying commercial products mentioned within a publisher’s content, VigLink automatically invigorates those terms by transforming them into hyperlinks whose destinations are determined in real-time, advertiser-bid auctions. Yes, hyperlinks, the defining feature of the Web from the very start. The literal “H” in HTML. Every time a clicked link takes a person from one destination to another, value is created. However, that value has never been fairly priced or available for purchase at scale. Until now.</p>\\n\\n<p>Founded in 2009, VigLink is located in heart of San Francisco and backed by top investors including Google Ventures, Emergence Capital, and RRE. VigLink manages a publisher network of over 2 million sites and apps, as well as an advertiser network of over 70,000 brands and merchants.</p>\\n\\n<p>About the role:</p>\\n\\n<p>VigLink is seeking a Data Scientist or Machine Learning Engineer with strong Hadoop, Hive and SQL skills, and experience creating production-quality code in Python, R, or other related languages. We are looking for folks who enjoy working on a variety of different types of analyses, ranging from ad-hoc \"data wrangling\" tasks through the creation of full-blown programs to calculate business-critical, customer-visible values on an ongoing basis, enjoy thinking through a data problem, understanding the customer needs associated with it, and working on your own and with other developers to create a pragmatic solution.</p>\\n\\n<p>At VigLink we love go-getters and people who like working in an Agile, best-practices environment - who understand the importance of testable, modular, efficient code, so that\\'s what you write.</p>\\n\\n<p>Required Qualifications:</p>\\n\\n<p>Minimum of 3 years experience in relevant analytics tasks with strong Python, R, Matlab, or related language<br>\\nExperience training and implementing supervised and/or unsupervised learning models\\u2002<br>\\nSolid understanding of databases and SQL<br>\\nCapacious curiosity for data and algorithms, and how to apply them to create insight<br>\\nExperience with Linux/Unix—you are comfortable on the command line<br>\\nExperience in the e-commerce, web analytics, search, and cloud computing space<br>\\nBA/BS degree in Computer Science preferred with a strong academic record (MS/PhD or equivalent a plus)</p>\\n\\n<p>Preferred Qualifications:</p>\\n\\n<p>NLP experience particularly with concepts such as document classification, named entity recognition/disambiguation, and topic modelling<br>\\nExperience with Java, or a JVM based language like Scala<br>\\nExperience with the Hadoop ecosystem, particularly Pig and Hive</p>\\n\\n<p>A few fun problems we\\'re working on:</p>\\n\\n<p>Feature Extraction and Context / Product Inference\\nIdentify the commercial context of publisher content, identify the relevance of commercial links to that content, and match relevant destinations to appropriate products / services available across the web.</p>\\n\\n<p>Statistical Modeling and Prediction of Earnings\\nModel the performance of our existing publishers and merchants to predict future performance at high granularity.</p>\\n\\n<p>Large-Data Analytics and Audience Profiling\\nDevelop automated insights that help publishers improve their performance by developing a better understanding of their audiences based on billions of impressions and tens of millions of clicks per week.

       "     'description': '<p>Software Developer </p>\\n\\n<p>Jane Street is a proprietary quantitative trading firm, focusing primarily on trading equities and equity derivatives. We use innovative technology, a scientific approach, and a deep understanding of markets to stay successful in our highly competitive field. We operate around the clock and around the globe, employing over 500 people in offices in New York, London and Hong Kong.</p>\\n\\n<p>The markets in which we trade change rapidly, but our intellectual approach changes faster still. Every day, we have new problems to solve and new theories to test. Our entrepreneurial culture is driven by our talented team of traders and programmers. At Jane Street, we don\\'t come to work wanting to leave. We come to work excited to test new theories, have thought-provoking discussions, and maybe sneak in a game of ping-pong or two. Keeping our culture casual and our employees happy is of paramount importance to us.</p>\\n\\n<p>We are looking to hire great software developers with an interest in functional programming. OCaml, a statically typed functional programming language with similarities to Haskell, Scheme, Erlang, F# and SML, is our language of choice. We\\'ve got the largest team of OCaml developers in any industrial setting, and probably the world\\'s largest OCaml codebase. We use OCaml for running our entire business, supporting everything from research to systems administration to trading systems. If you\\'re interested in seeing how functional programming plays out in the real world, there\\'s no better place.</p>\\n\\n<p>The atmosphere is informal and intellectual. There is a focus on education, and people learn about software and trading, both through formal classes and on the job. The work is challenging, and you get to see the practical impact of your efforts in quick and dramatic terms. Jane Street is also small enough that people have the freedom to get involved in many different areas of the business. Compensation is highly competitive, and there\\'s a lot of room for growth.</p>\\n\\n<p>You can learn more about Jane Street and our technology from our main site, janestreet.com. You can also look at a a talk given at CMU about why Jane Street uses functional programming (<a href=\"http://ocaml.janestreet.com/?q=node/61\">http://ocaml.janestreet.com/?q=node/61</a>), and our programming blog (<a href=\"http://ocaml.janestreet.com\">http://ocaml.janestreet.com</a>).</p>\\n\\n<p>We also have extensive benefits, including:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>90% book reimbursement for work-related books</li>\\n<li>90% tuition reimbursement for continuing education</li>\\n<li>Excellent, zero-premium medical and dental insurance</li>\\n<li>Free lunch delivered daily from a selection of restaurants</li>\\n<li>Catered breakfasts and fresh brewed Peet\\'s coffee</li>\\n<li>An on-site, private gym in New York with towel service</li>\\n<li>Kitchens fully stocked with a variety of snack choices</li>\\n<li>Full company 401(k) match up to 6% of salary, vests immediately</li>\\n</ul><p>More information at <a href=\"http://janestreet.com/culture/benefits/\">http://janestreet.com/culture/benefits/</a></p>',\n",

I used my numerical package to predict the location. The cruises\\nwere deployed in August 2015 to the designated location to perform the field measurements and the\\npredicted region remained coherent over the course of measurements.\\nDesign and fabrication of a 3 degree-of-freedom underwater robot, an observation-class Remotely\\nOperated Vehicle (ROV). It features Ethernet telemetry, live video stream, and a sensory module\\nthat involves accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, depth, and temperature sensors.

A low error rate was achieved. Additionally, a robotic attack against smartphones\\nwas designed and developed, to break a touch based authentication system.

Also, I designed and developed an adversary template drifting\\nagainst template updating mechanisms. The attack was shown to increase system error rate for between 200%\\nand 600%, and had changed over 40% of well-performed users to ill-performed users. To further investigate\\nthe dangerous of such attack, I tested the attack in various scenarios to analyze how the attack perform against\\ndefensive mechanism and how defensive mechanism limits the benefit reaped from template updating.\\nBuilt a bench mark test for touch stroke verification on smartphones.

This is needed because there is no standard naming convention for\\ncommercials. Therefore, if one wants to find a commercial in the database in order to get\\nthe corresponding analysis, they can watch 50000 ads or just upload the video into the\\nrecognition system and have the machine search the entire database and find all ads with\\nsimilar audio sections. The top N matches are all classified with a custom Bayesian\\nclassifier, which can be trained robustly with as little as 50 (or less) total examples of\\nduplicates, near duplicates and non-duplicates.\\nAlthough this is a large-scale and on-going project, it is a fully functional and\\nindispensable part of the day-to-day business operations. As with most of my projects, I\\nhave taken this from the initial concept, through the R&D phase, all the way to a stable\\nrunning production system. This system uses no 3rd party software for any of the primary\\nalgorithms*, of which there are many, it is custom work and has been submitted for\\npatent. *(except Redis for runtime storage, persistence and fault tolerance)\\nReal Time Automatic Demographic Smoother For Online Survey Management\\n(Patent Pending )\\nDesigned the algorithm (was implemented by engineering team) to automatically manage\\nan online survey taking process. The goal being to obtain a desired demographic\\ndistribution of survey takers by the time the survey closes. The system accepts or rejects\\npossible survey takers in real time as the survey is being fielded, automatically balancing\\nmultiple demographic goals and restrictions (mins) simultaneously. The system is\\nparameterized such that one can exchange speed in filling the survey (cheaper) for\\naccuracy in the desired demographic distribution (better data).\\nCommercial Features as a Vector Space\\nDesigned a new and rich feature representation for ads based on an eigenvector\\ndecomposition (svd, matrix factorization) of a transformation of the traditional ace Metrix\\nscores. This resulted in a vector-space of automatically determined commercial\\nproperties, such as an \"entertainment\" axis (measures how entertaining an ad is - largest\\neigenvalue), an \"indulgence\" axis (things desired but not needed), a \"general appeal\"\\naxis, a \"shocking\" axis,...etc). Since this is a true vector space one can add property\\ncoordinates together to get the coordinates for ads with the combined properties. For\\nexample, if one added the coordinates for high \"indulgence\" to the coordinates for high\\n\"general appeal\" they will find chocolate ads, as well as others that fulfill this\\ncombination of traits.\\nTelevision Ad Acquisition System\\nOversaw the creation of the main ad acquisition system for Ace Metrix. The primary\\nfunction is to provide a front end web site to facilitate the processing of incoming ads\\nallowing for quality assurance and cleaning up of audio and video while performing back\\nend functions such as transcoding to all relevant formats and resolutions, sending ads to\\nthe audio/video recognition system for duplicate detection and passing along to the next\\nsystems in the work flow. Leveraging Amazon Workflow, S3, SQS and other cloud\\nservices for scalability and interoperability with other systems.\\nMulti Ad-Campaign Optimization\\nDesigned and coded a system that automatically finds the optimal (or near optimal) ad\\nplacement with respect to a given ad space purchase (typically around 100 to 1000 spots/\\npods). The ads, usually a set of four, come ranked according to how much they are liked/\\ndisliked as a function of age and gender demographics. The system also takes into\\naccount how many times an ad must be seen before it is effective (wear-in and wear-out).\\nThis makes the problem extremely non-linear and NP complete - 4 to power 1000 is a\\nvery large number. The final result finds the best ad placement such that it is viewed at\\nleast the minimum number of times and only by people who like the ad (the system\\nstrategically avoids those demographics that did not respond well to the ad during the\\ntesting phase). In addition, optimal rotation schedules come as a by-product of the\\ncompleted\\noptimization process.\\nText Analytics\\nDesigned and coded a system that analyzes and groups a collection sentences gathered\\nfrom a set of open-ended text responses taken from online surveys. The sentences are\\nclustered/grouped according to their mutual semantic similarity (Novel). The results are\\ndisplayed in a structured hierarchical scheme thus allowing one to view the \"center\" and\\nclosely similar sentences of each cluster. In this way one can get a quick synopsis, at\\nmultiple levels of resolution, of what people are saying and how many people are saying\\nit.\\nUsed Gensim with multiple lables to compute advertisement similarities and extract\\ntopics from free text responses by using ica on the resulting word vector space to find\\nnon-guaissian distributions (\"pure\" topics) - seemed to work better than the LDA. This\\nsystem is great for finding ads that have any given property. On a database of over 40000\\nads, one can query `celebrities\\', and find all the ads that have celebrities in them. Or, one\\ncan query `funny\\' and find funny ads. Or, one can query `wtf\\' and find all the ads that\\nconfused or shocked people, and much much more...\\nVideo Recognition System\\nThis CUDA GPU based system compares videos and classifies match results for easy\\ninspection and interpretation. It is used often in conjunction with the audio recognition\\nsystem above in which the top N audio matches are served up to the video recognition\\nsystem. The Bayesian classifier uses features such as entropy, average similarity, max\\nsimilarity and others that result from the model graph similarities.\\nThe system is based on a Gabor-based feature space that models the cell responses of a\\nhyper-column of cortex in the mammalian visual system V1. This technology was first\\nput to test by one of my advisors (Malsburg et al.) in the famous FERET Face\\nRecognition Competition in which it took first place.\\nVideo Compression as a means to a robust video representation for database storage\\nand similarity search (key frame selection)\\nTakes a video file as input and transforms each frame into a strategically chosen and\\nhighly compressed 40 (or 80) dimensional vector. This representation is then used to\\ncompute a relative stability value for each frame that describes how similar it is to its\\nsurrounding frames (integrating multiple window sizes). Frames at the peaks of the\\nstability curve are prime candidates for key frame selection (center of the frame cluster)\\nthus allowing one to store only few frames to represent the entire file. The idea is to\\nidentify the same stable regions in any version (diff quality, resolution, aspect ratio, parts)\\nof the same commercial and search for just those frames. Typically a 30 sec commercial\\nthat contains 900 frames can be reduced to between 5 and 30 key frames.\\nAutomatic Video Summary (scene selection)\\nBy using the above key frame selection system. One can then extract blocks of frames\\naround each key frame, being careful not to cross scene cuts (which are automatically\\ndetermined). The blocks are then selected or deselected using a simulated annealing\\nalgorithm such that there are no cuts between scenes that are too similar (because it looks\\nweird and unnatural) and that the total time for the video summary is of a desired length.\\nThese are used in the UI as `animated video thumbnails\\' that quickly allow one to see\\nmany ads at once and select the correct one (again, the names don\\'t always tell you\\nenough info). In addition, this analysis produces interesting metadata like cut rate, energy\\n(motion), number of scenes...etc.\\nSurvey Agreement-Control Analysis and Scores\\nDeveloped the technical analysis for analyzing trace curves taken from survey responders\\nas they watch a commercial and a move a lever up for when they like what they are\\nseeing and down when they don\\'t. The curves can be remarkably noisy and benefit from\\nsome strategic preprocessing and noise reduction. They are then clustered according to\\nsimilar reactions to the stimulus. The different clusters can then be analyzed for any\\ndemographic insights (i.e., females loved the beginning and males loved the ending but\\nolder males in the middle income bracket loved it all)\\nLogo Detection (in development)\\nApplied the model graph approach to logo detection in videos using CUDA for fast\\nmatrix calculations and Gabor transforms. System is in development and the results are\\nvery exciting.\\nAutomatic Ad Harvester\\nCombined low level (local Gabor features, color similarity, temporal edge detection,...\\netc) and high level features (audio recognition) in a system that `watches\\' TV and\\nidentifies where the commercials are (to the frame) and stores them for later analysis.\\nBuilt prototype system and demonstrated proof of concept but system was never pushed\\nto production due to other unrelated logistics.\\nAcademic Research and Lab Experience\\nFace Detection\\nOptimized the computer representation (object representation) for a face detection\\nsystem. The optimization is arrived at through an evolutionary process and a Bayesian\\nstatistical analysis of facial feature vectors. This analysis yields a position and feature\\ndependant facial entropy measure which can be used as a weighting scheme for the\\nfeature vector elements within the architecture of the facial representation scheme to\\nimprove detection accuracy.\\nObject Tracking\\nOptimization of an object\\'s representation by tracking the object in a video sequence.\\nReduced the dimension of an object\\'s computer representation by using a tracking task as\\na fitness measure in an evolutionary algorithm. The result was that only those features\\nthat are necessary to perform the tracking task survive the evolutionary process.\\nAge Estimation\\nDesigned and coded a system capable of accurately guessing a person\\'s age based on a\\ngood frontal photograph of a person\\'s face .\\nFull Body Person Recognition\\nHeavily collaborated in the design and implementation of a full-body human recognition\\nsystem.

It was applied for estimation of failure probabilities of tall buildings subject to earthquake\\nexcitations. In recognition of the efficiency of the method, I was invited to contribute papers to the Springer\\nEncyclopedia of Earthquake Engineering, the Springer Handbook on Uncertainty Quantification, and to speak at\\nthe Southern California Probability Symposium.\\nDeveloped a new stochastic model for time evolution of real complex networks. This was the first model that\\ngenerated networks with all three universal properties of real complex networks: heavy tail degree\\ndistribution, high clustering, and community structure. The model was applied to describe the growth of the\\nInternet. The results were published in Nature Scientific Reports.\\nExtended the formalism of exponential random graphs to simplicial complexes which made possible modeling\\ncomplex system beyond dyadic interactions. The results were published in Journal of Physics A: Mathematical\\nand Theoretical.\\nRESEARCH PUBLICATIONS\\nAll publications are available at http://www.its.caltech.edu/~zuev/publications.html\\nAuthor of 18 publications (11 as the first author) in top scientific and engineering journals, including Nature\\nScientific Reports, Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical, Probabilistic Engineering Mechanics.\\nAuthor of 12 conference papers (9 as the first author) at international conferences and workshops.\\nORAL PRESENTATIONS\\nSlides of selected talks are available at http://www.its.caltech.edu/~zuev/talks.html\\nMade more than 20 presentations (4 as invited speaker) at international conferences, workshops, and\\nsymposia in the US, UK, Russia, Hong Kong, Singapore, Greece, Ukraine, and Germany.\\nTEACHING EXPERIENCE\\nCourse materials are available at http://www.its.caltech.edu/~zuev/teaching.html\\nSupervised 8 undergraduate and 6 PhD students\\nApplied Linear Algebra, Caltech, Spring 2016\\nIntroduction to MATLAB and Mathematica, Caltech, Spring 2016\\nIntroduction to Statistical Inference, Caltech, Winter 2016\\nUncertainty, Reliability and Risk, University of Liverpool, Winter 2013.\\nMathematical Statistics, University of Southern California, Spring 2012, Spring 2013.\\nMathematics of Physics and Engineering, University of Southern California, Spring 2012.\\nFundamental Principles of Calculus, University of Southern California, Fall 2011, Fall 2012\\nPROFESSIONAL SERVICE\\nOrganized 9 mini-symposia and special sessions at various scientific and engineering conferences.\\nActive reviewer for 13 top journals, including PLOS ONE, Physical Reviews E, Random Structures and\\nAlgorithms, and SIAM/ASA Journal on Uncertainty Quantification.\\nReviewer for 7 international conferences, including 11th and 12th International Conferences on Applications of\\nStatistics and Probability, 2nd International Conference on Vulnerability and Risk Analysis and Management,\\nand 6th International Symposium on Uncertainty Modelling and Analysis.\\nChairman of the Committee on Probability and Statistics in the Physical Sciences, Bernoulli Society for\\nMathematical Statistics and Probability, 2015-2017.\\nInvited Member of the ASCE Infrastructure Resilience Division, Risk and Resilience Measurements Committee,\\nRisk, Uncertainty and Resilience Quantification Subcommittee, 2015.\\nPage 2 of 2'},\n",

In two-sided markets, when content providers have heteroge-\\nneous interaction benefits (i.e. some content providers benefits more from their interactions with\\nconsumers), platforms could use low-priced exclusive contracts to attract content providers with\\nlow interaction benefits. Content providers with high interaction benefits prefer high-priced non-\\nexclusive contracts because the exclusive requirement limits the number of interactions they could\\nhave. If exclusive dealing is banned, a platforms best option may be to attract only the lucrative\\nhigh-interaction-benefit type. Thus, exclusive dealing increases the number of participating content\\nproviders, which increases both consumer welfare and social welfare through the network effects.\\nThis could happen regardless of the strength of the network effects as long as the difference in in-\\nteraction benefits is large. Moreover, competition will force at least one of the platforms to offer\\nexclusive contracts in addition to non-exclusive contracts.\\n\"Network Effects, Differentiation, and Tipping: Evidence from Instant Video Stream-\\ning Industry\"\\nThis paper investigates the effects of content heterogeneity on platforms\\' competition strategies and\\nexplains why many two-sided markets do not tip. Exclusive content appealing to the general public\\ncould enhance network effects. On the other hand, exclusive distinctive content could differenti-\\nate platforms. I predict that if there exists sufficiently contrasting content, both platforms would\\nchoose differentiation in equilibrium in order to soften competition and popular content would turn\\nout to be non-exclusive so that the market does not tip. Using data of all of the movies on the\\nmajor subscription-based video streaming platforms, this study finds that popular movies are signif-\\nicantly more likely to be non-exclusive. In addition, streaming companies want to further distinguish\\nthemselves by building strength in genres that attract different groups of viewers. These empirical\\nfindings are consistent with the analytical results.\\n\"Forced Exclusivity and Determinants of Exclusivity\"\\nEven though exclusive dealing has many benefits to firms, platforms in two-sided markets do not\\nuse \"forced exclusivity\" contracts. Instead, they negotiate both exclusive and non-exclusive con-\\ntracts with content providers and let content providers decide which type of contract to sign. The\\nreason is that when only exclusive contracts are offered, if content providers reject one platform\\'s\\noffer, they have to join the other platform exclusively. The cost of losing content providers is larger\\ncompared with when non-exclusivity is the other option for content providers. So a platform has to\\npay more for forced exclusivity, which completely outweighs the benefits of exclusivity. This paper\\nalso finds that smaller bargaining power of platforms, difference in amounts of proprietary content,\\nor consumer surplus per content makes content providers more willing to sign non-exclusive contracts.\\n\"How Do Free Products Compete, Offensively or Defensively?\"\\nMany online services have a radical price--zero. In order to attract users, firms have to compete\\nin product quality instead of price. In addition, they can increase switching costs to discourage\\nuser switching. Using a model with endogenous quality and switching costs, this paper shows that\\noligopolistic competition forces firms to improve only product quality. Moreover, the proportion of\\nusers with zero switching cost determines firms investments in product quality. Mostly importantly,\\nthe relative size of a firm does not affect its investment decision.\\nPROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCES 2008 2009\\nResearch Analyst, RTI International\\nLed water-saving and sanitation technologies commercialization project\\nSupported green technology, corporate property data, and other projects\\nResearch Assistant, Duke University 2007\\nSupported Professor Charles Becker in Chinese social security system project\\nSoftware Engineer, Join-Cheer Software, Ltd. 2003 2004\\nDesigned and developed Leader Query System which was incorporated into Join-Cheer Busi-\\nness Intelligence in 2010\\nParticipated in Join-Cheer Reporting Table Management System\\nTEACHING EXPERIENCE Spring 2012\\nHead Teaching Assistant, University of Texas at Austin\\nMacroeconomics Theory Spring 2015\\nTeaching Assistant, University of Texas at Austin Fall 2014\\nIntroduction to Microeconomics (Web Based) Spring 2013\\nIntroduction to Microeconomics (Web Based) Fall 2012\\nFall 2011\\nIntroduction to Microeconomics\\nIndustrial Organization\\nIntroduction to Microeconomics\\nPROFESSIONAL SERVICE AND ACTIVITIES\\nDepartment Representative at the UT Graduate Student Association\\nMember, American Economics Association\\nMember, Information Systems Association\\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\\nCitizenship: P.R.

He was ranked within the\\n4th percent of the best students with weighted overall grade A.\\nHe won a PricewaterhouseCoopers Financial Challenge 2012 in Czech Republic, and his\\nbachelor thesis is currently getting published in scientific journal in Czech\\nRepublic.\\nThen, he has been selected among 1500 applications to be admitted in the Erasmus\\nMundus Master programme in Data Mining and Knowledge Management (EM-DMKM) and to be\\ngranted with a EM scholarship of excellence. He obtained very good results with A\\ngrades during the first year of the Master programme in Polytech Nantes, France.\\nNow, He is completing the 2nd year of the master programme in Univ.

It was a pleasure for me to lead\\nhim throughout writing the final thesis. He worked on the thesis really hard and\\nconscientiously. Brilliantly copes with work in SAS software.\\nJose Garcia Moreno-Torres - I was lucky enough to stumble upon Lukas when I was\\nstarting to build the Data Science team at the very beginning of 2014. Spending 5\\nminutes chatting with him is enough to realize he is an incredibly bright and\\ntalented individual who could excel in pretty much anything he wanted.

He grew extremely fast in terms of both technical\\nskills and personal development, and was within a few months leading some of the\\nmost challenging projects we worked on.\\nOn the personal side, he is extremely fun to work with, a real asset to any team\\nwho also has the potential to grow into a great leader. I will be avidly following\\nhis career from here onward, I am sure he will accomplish great things.\\nChristophe THOVEX - I warmly recommend Lukas\\' skills to any employer/professor. It\\nwas the first time I had to manage students who asked me more work to do on\\nThursday because their weekly tasks were already done (!), even though the subject\\nwas based on genome sequencing tools and phylogenetic trees, with complex\\nalgorithms and a high level of abstraction regarding the domain of application\\n(finding similar emotion profiles in EEG traces).

This method models a given flow field as a superposition\\nof simple harmonic oscillators, and is trained to classify patterns of the turbulent features of the flow\\nfield. Lifetime of the detected features is then predicted using a non-linear regression model. The model\\nis trained and validated using a significantly large dataset of surface flow fields of the oceans measured\\nby satellites (23-years of global and daily flow fields). This package is currently in use at MIT, EAPS\\ndepartment.\\nMatlab/Python Finite Size/Time Lyapunov Exponent (FSLE/FTLE): A Lagrangian numerical package to charac-\\nterize the transport properties of turbulent fluids, such as those of the ocean surface, and to identify the\\ncoherent structures. It translates the real-time altimetric data provided by NASA satellites into flow\\nfields and then analyze them using Lagrangian algorithms. A grid of tracer particles is initialized over\\nthe domain of interest. The flow map is then approximated by integrating particle trajectories. The\\ndispersion of these trajectories shed light on the flow characteristics.

This package is currently in use at MIT, EAPS\\ndepartment.\\nMatlab/Python Finite Size/Time Lyapunov Exponent (FSLE/FTLE): A Lagrangian numerical package to charac-\\nterize the transport properties of turbulent fluids, such as those of the ocean surface, and to identify the\\ncoherent structures. It translates the real-time altimetric data provided by NASA satellites into flow\\nfields and then analyze them using Lagrangian algorithms. A grid of tracer particles is initialized over\\nthe domain of interest. The flow map is then approximated by integrating particle trajectories. The\\ndispersion of these trajectories shed light on the flow characteristics. This package is currently in use at\\nMIT, EAPS department.\\nMatlab/Python Eddy (Vortex) Identification: A post-processing tool for MITgcm (a non-hydrostatic finite-volume\\nnumerical model of the Earth\\'s atmosphere and oceans, e-version: click here). It employs an Eulerian\\napproach to compute the normal and shear components of the strain, and reveals the relative dominance\\nof vorticity and deformation at turbulent fluids. This package is currently in use at MIT, EAPS\\ndepartment.\\nDelphi/Matlab Dipole Interaction of Confined Atoms in Magnetic Traps and Interactions With Microwave\\nRadiation: An adaptive stepsize Runge-Kutta algorithm was developed to model the dynamics of\\nantihydrogen atoms confined in the magnetic well constructed in the ALPHA apparatus (at CERN).\\nThese atoms are then exposed to microwave radiation and their quantum transitions are modeled using\\nLandau-Zener approximation (see Nature 483, 439 (2012), and Ph.D Thesis, e-version: click here and\\nhere).\\nDelphi/Matlab Statistical Modeling of the Interaction of Microwave Radiation With Atomic Systems: A com-\\nbination of Monte-Carlo and test statistic (Likelihood Ratio) algorithms was developed to model the\\nstatistical behavior of an ensemble of antihydrogen atoms after resonant interactions with microwave\\nradiation (Ph.D Thesis, e-version: click here).\\nCOMSOL Cavity Resonator: Design and Modeling of a Dielectric Loaded RF Cavity Resonator Tuned at 115 GHz\\n(Ph.D Thesis).\\nCOMSOL & Superconductor Resonator: Design and Modeling of a High-Q Superconductor (Niobium) /2 Mi-\\nANSYS HFSS crostrip Line Resonator (Ph.D Thesis).\\n2/4\\nSELECTED SOFTWARE PROJECTS:\\nDelphi/ eLog: A central electronic log-book that stores and shares the experiments, data files and analysis of\\nMySQL the personnel of a research laboratory.

This method was applied on a large data set of the oceans surface flow fields collected\\nby satellites (see SELECTED NUMERICAL PROJECTS).\\nLed developing an open source numerical package to identify and predict turbulent structures in the\\noceans using real-time NASA satellite altimetric data (see SELECTED NUMERICAL PROJECTS).\\nCollaboration with SCOPE project, a large ocean ecology experiment, in order to pinpoint a highly\\ncoherent region in the North Pacific Ocean, and guide the deployment of two expedition cruises\\nwith 60 scientists on board. I used my numerical package to predict the location. The cruises\\nwere deployed in August 2015 to the designated location to perform the field measurements and the\\npredicted region remained coherent over the course of measurements.\\nDesign and fabrication of a 3 degree-of-freedom underwater robot, an observation-class Remotely\\nOperated Vehicle (ROV). It features Ethernet telemetry, live video stream, and a sensory module\\nthat involves accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, depth, and temperature sensors. This is a\\nproject at its final stages and is expected to deliver low-cost underwater observational robots to the\\noceanography field experiments.\\n1/4\\n2009 2014 Research Assistant at CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research):\\nCollaborated with ALPHA experiment at CERN, a world-class physics laboratory in Switzerland.\\nApplied pioneering techniques to measure the quantum states of antihydrogen atom using microwave\\nradiation, a historic measurement for the first time in physics.\\nDeveloped a numerical model simulating the interaction of antihydrogen atoms with microwaves; a\\nprocess that involves numerical PDE algorithms, non-deterministic algorithms, and test statistics (see\\nSELECTED NUMERICAL PROJECTS).\\nOur cutting-edge achievements led to multiple publications in the prestigious journal of Nature,\\nnominated as the \"physics breakthrough of the year\", and received world-wide media attention\\n(e-version, click here: BBC documentary, CNN, CBC, BBC ... ).\\n2007 2014 Lead Software Developer at Mahya ITS and Alvan ComTronic, Iran:\\nLed development of a sophisticated software solution for urban traffic management through an\\nintegrated network of LED displays across the country. The package involves various front-end\\napplications, database layer, and services (see SELECTED SOFTWARE PROJECTS section).\\nCurrently, the software package is under heavy use at the traffic control centers of the major cities\\nacross the country.\\nSELECTED NUMERICAL PROJECTS:\\nPython Machine Learning & Fluid Dynamics: A series of novel machine learning solutions that detect\\nturbulent structures and predict their lifetime. This method models a given flow field as a superposition\\nof simple harmonic oscillators, and is trained to classify patterns of the turbulent features of the flow\\nfield. Lifetime of the detected features is then predicted using a non-linear regression model. The model\\nis trained and validated using a significantly large dataset of surface flow fields of the oceans measured\\nby satellites (23-years of global and daily flow fields). This package is currently in use at MIT, EAPS\\ndepartment.\\nMatlab/Python Finite Size/Time Lyapunov Exponent (FSLE/FTLE): A Lagrangian numerical package to charac-\\nterize the transport properties of turbulent fluids, such as those of the ocean surface, and to identify the\\ncoherent structures. It translates the real-time altimetric data provided by NASA satellites into flow\\nfields and then analyze them using Lagrangian algorithms. A grid of tracer particles is initialized over\\nthe domain of interest. The flow map is then approximated by integrating particle trajectories. The\\ndispersion of these trajectories shed light on the flow characteristics. This package is currently in use at\\nMIT, EAPS department.\\nMatlab/Python Eddy (Vortex) Identification: A post-processing tool for MITgcm (a non-hydrostatic finite-volume\\nnumerical model of the Earth\\'s atmosphere and oceans, e-version: click here). It employs an Eulerian\\napproach to compute the normal and shear components of the strain, and reveals the relative dominance\\nof vorticity and deformation at turbulent fluids. This package is currently in use at MIT, EAPS\\ndepartment.\\nDelphi/Matlab Dipole Interaction of Confined Atoms in Magnetic Traps and Interactions With Microwave\\nRadiation: An adaptive stepsize Runge-Kutta algorithm was developed to model the dynamics of\\nantihydrogen atoms confined in the magnetic well constructed in the ALPHA apparatus (at CERN).\\nThese atoms are then exposed to microwave radiation and their quantum transitions are modeled using\\nLandau-Zener approximation (see Nature 483, 439 (2012), and Ph.D Thesis, e-version: click here and\\nhere).\\nDelphi/Matlab Statistical Modeling of the Interaction of Microwave Radiation With Atomic Systems: A com-\\nbination of Monte-Carlo and test statistic (Likelihood Ratio) algorithms was developed to model the\\nstatistical behavior of an ensemble of antihydrogen atoms after resonant interactions with microwave\\nradiation (Ph.D Thesis, e-version: click here).\\nCOMSOL Cavity Resonator: Design and Modeling of a Dielectric Loaded RF Cavity Resonator Tuned at 115 GHz\\n(Ph.D Thesis).\\nCOMSOL & Superconductor Resonator: Design and Modeling of a High-Q Superconductor (Niobium) /2 Mi-\\nANSYS HFSS crostrip Line Resonator (Ph.D Thesis).\\n2/4\\nSELECTED SOFTWARE PROJECTS:\\nDelphi/ eLog: A central electronic log-book that stores and shares the experiments, data files and analysis of\\nMySQL the personnel of a research laboratory. It also provides an environment for on-line discussions regarding\\nthe experiments. This application is currently in use at the Friedman Lab in Amherst College, MA, USA.\\nDelphi/ Arena: A software suite containing several services and applications to control and maintain an urban\\nC# .net/ network of electronic traffic signs and full-color LED displays. It is designed to automatically generate\\nSQL Server content for the LED displays across the city, according to the traffic level. It also involves multi-media\\nfeatures such as filters, effects, transitions, and subtitles to generate video files. These files are then\\ntransmitted to the LED displays using different communication methods (TCP/IP, GPRS). Currently\\nthis package is in heavy use at the traffic control center of the city of Tehran, Iran (e-version: click here\\nand here).\\nDelphi/ vSign: A service application that sits on the LED displays and can communicate with Arena over the\\nC# .net network. It receives the files from Arena and then displays them on the LED display. It also connects to\\nthe network of urban cameras and can capture and display the camera streams in real-time.

The package involves various front-end\\napplications, database layer, and services (see SELECTED SOFTWARE PROJECTS section).\\nCurrently, the software package is under heavy use at the traffic control centers of the major cities\\nacross the country.\\nSELECTED NUMERICAL PROJECTS:\\nPython Machine Learning & Fluid Dynamics: A series of novel machine learning solutions that detect\\nturbulent structures and predict their lifetime. This method models a given flow field as a superposition\\nof simple harmonic oscillators, and is trained to classify patterns of the turbulent features of the flow\\nfield. Lifetime of the detected features is then predicted using a non-linear regression model. The model\\nis trained and validated using a significantly large dataset of surface flow fields of the oceans measured\\nby satellites (23-years of global and daily flow fields). This package is currently in use at MIT, EAPS\\ndepartment.\\nMatlab/Python Finite Size/Time Lyapunov Exponent (FSLE/FTLE): A Lagrangian numerical package to charac-\\nterize the transport properties of turbulent fluids, such as those of the ocean surface, and to identify the\\ncoherent structures. It translates the real-time altimetric data provided by NASA satellites into flow\\nfields and then analyze them using Lagrangian algorithms. A grid of tracer particles is initialized over\\nthe domain of interest. The flow map is then approximated by integrating particle trajectories. The\\ndispersion of these trajectories shed light on the flow characteristics. This package is currently in use at\\nMIT, EAPS department.\\nMatlab/Python Eddy (Vortex) Identification: A post-processing tool for MITgcm (a non-hydrostatic finite-volume\\nnumerical model of the Earth\\'s atmosphere and oceans, e-version: click here). It employs an Eulerian\\napproach to compute the normal and shear components of the strain, and reveals the relative dominance\\nof vorticity and deformation at turbulent fluids. This package is currently in use at MIT, EAPS\\ndepartment.\\nDelphi/Matlab Dipole Interaction of Confined Atoms in Magnetic Traps and Interactions With Microwave\\nRadiation: An adaptive stepsize Runge-Kutta algorithm was developed to model the dynamics of\\nantihydrogen atoms confined in the magnetic well constructed in the ALPHA apparatus (at CERN).\\nThese atoms are then exposed to microwave radiation and their quantum transitions are modeled using\\nLandau-Zener approximation (see Nature 483, 439 (2012), and Ph.D Thesis, e-version: click here and\\nhere).\\nDelphi/Matlab Statistical Modeling of the Interaction of Microwave Radiation With Atomic Systems: A com-\\nbination of Monte-Carlo and test statistic (Likelihood Ratio) algorithms was developed to model the\\nstatistical behavior of an ensemble of antihydrogen atoms after resonant interactions with microwave\\nradiation (Ph.D Thesis, e-version: click here).\\nCOMSOL Cavity Resonator: Design and Modeling of a Dielectric Loaded RF Cavity Resonator Tuned at 115 GHz\\n(Ph.D Thesis).\\nCOMSOL & Superconductor Resonator: Design and Modeling of a High-Q Superconductor (Niobium) /2 Mi-\\nANSYS HFSS crostrip Line Resonator (Ph.D Thesis).\\n2/4\\nSELECTED SOFTWARE PROJECTS:\\nDelphi/ eLog: A central electronic log-book that stores and shares the experiments, data files and analysis of\\nMySQL the personnel of a research laboratory. It also provides an environment for on-line discussions regarding\\nthe experiments. This application is currently in use at the Friedman Lab in Amherst College, MA, USA.\\nDelphi/ Arena: A software suite containing several services and applications to control and maintain an urban\\nC# .net/ network of electronic traffic signs and full-color LED displays. It is designed to automatically generate\\nSQL Server content for the LED displays across the city, according to the traffic level. It also involves multi-media\\nfeatures such as filters, effects, transitions, and subtitles to generate video files. These files are then\\ntransmitted to the LED displays using different communication methods (TCP/IP, GPRS). Currently\\nthis package is in heavy use at the traffic control center of the city of Tehran, Iran (e-version: click here\\nand here).\\nDelphi/ vSign: A service application that sits on the LED displays and can communicate with Arena over the\\nC# .net network. It receives the files from Arena and then displays them on the LED display. It also connects to\\nthe network of urban cameras and can capture and display the camera streams in real-time.

We employed blind and semi-blind source separation\\nmethods such as parametric (extended Kalman filtering), nonparametric or statistical (Gaussian process\\nanalysis), and deterministic (robust tensor decomposition) methods to separate fetal and maternal\\ncardiac signals. The databases used in this project included PhysioNet and DaISy public fetal ECG\\ndatasets, and a twin fetal MCG dataset.\\nM.Sc.

Our approach was to find features that separate interictal (seizure free), preictal (instances\\nright before seizure) and ictal (during seizure) intervals of EEG recordings (both rat and human data).\\nMoreover, we worked on classification of healthy, interictal and ictal EEG signals. To do this we\\nutilized several appropriate signal-processing techniques such as dynamical systems analysis (including\\nsimilarity indices and recurrence quantification analysis) and wavelet analysis. The main database for\\nthis project had been provided by Pasteur Institute of Iran based on their research collaboration with\\nSharif University of Technology. We also used recognized databases such as Bonn and Freiburg\\ndatasets to evaluate our methods.\\nB.Sc.

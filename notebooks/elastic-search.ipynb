       "     'content': '<h2>Optimal Decision Making with POMDPs</h2>\\n<p>In a previous episode, we discussed <a href=\"https://dataskeptic.com/blog/episodes/2018/markov-decision-processes\">Markov Decision Processes</a> or MDPs.  An MDP is defined by four parameters in the tuple <img className=\\'latex-svg\\' src=\\'http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/%5C%5Cbig+%5C%5Clangle+S%2C+A%2C+T%2C+R+%5C%5Cbig+%5C%5Crangle.svg\\' alt=\\'\\\\big \\\\langle S, A, T, R \\\\big \\\\rangle\\' />.  These variables are the states, actions, transition function, and reward function, described previously.</p>\\n<p>An MDP assumes that the state of the world is completely observable to an agent.  This is true in many games, like Chess.  While players cannot directly observe each other\\'s minds and what strategies their opponent might use, the location of every piece is common knowledge to both players.  In this way, the state is <em>fully</em> observable.</p>\\n<p>Yet in many situations, the state is not fully observable.  We can generalize the concept of an MDP to a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process or POMDP, and extend the same ideas to a more general class of environments in which an agent cannot directly observe the full state.</p>\\n<p>A simple example of a partially observable environment is Texas Hold \\'em Poker.  Remember that the true state includes every detail of the game - who has what cards in their hand as well as the order of the cards in the draw pile.  Each player can observe their own hand, but not the hand of their opponents.  Similarly, no players can observe the draw deck, but as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_card_poker\">community cards</a> are drawn and placed on the table, all players can view them.</p>\\n<p>The same idea generalizes to more real-world problems as well.  When you negotiate the purchase of a house, both the seller and the buyer have private information.  A smart (often legally required) step in the process is getting inspections and appraisals.  From the buyer\\'s perspective, these services are useful in that they reduce uncertainty about the home.</p>\\n<p>One problem a homeowner would like to avoid is termites.  A smart buyer can learn some of the visual signs of termite infestation/damage by doing a few basic Google Image Searches.  Those images will equip most buyers to notice obvious signs of termites, but not necessarily train their eye to be keen of all damages.  Perhaps the table below might describe how well a random person can detect a termite infestation.</p>\\n<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr>\\n<th></th>\\n<th align=\"center\">Found Evidence</th>\\n<th align=\"center\">Found No Evidence</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Has Termites</td>\\n<td align=\"center\">65%</td>\\n<td align=\"center\">45%</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>No Termites</td>\\n<td align=\"center\">10%</td>\\n<td align=\"center\">90%</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n<p>The rows represent ground truth.  The columns specify whether or not the prospective buyer believes they found evidence of termites.  When termites are present, the buyer is just a bit better than chance at discovering the evidence, doing so correctly 65% of the time.  Note that this has nothing to do with how likely a home is, in general, to have termites.  Simply that <em>given</em> that it does, the buyer has a limited ability to notice.</p>\\n<p>For the case of no termites present, the buyer makes a false positive 10% of the time.</p>\\n<p>Given these weak changes of discovering the truth, a buyer should really consult a professional.  [ Get your name here by contacting advertising@dataskeptic.com if you\\'re such a professional :) ]</p>\\n<p>Presumably, the trained inspector has a better observation function like the one below.</p>\\n<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr>\\n<th></th>\\n<th align=\"center\">Found Evidence</th>\\n<th align=\"center\">Found No Evidence</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Has Termites</td>\\n<td align=\"center\">98%</td>\\n<td align=\"center\">2%</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>No Termites</td>\\n<td align=\"center\">5%</td>\\n<td align=\"center\">95%</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n<p>Thus, the buyer should very much like to consult with the inspector on this matter.  Yet, contracting the inspector does not give access to ground truth.  It simply generates a report which we shall call an Observation.  In POMDPs, <img className=\\'latex-svg\\' src=\\'http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/%5C%5COmega.svg\\' alt=\\'\\\\Omega\\' /> is the set of all possible observations.  In our termite example, that would be <img className=\\'latex-svg\\' src=\\'http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/PassedInspection.svg\\' alt=\\'PassedInspection\\' /> and <img className=\\'latex-svg\\' src=\\'http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/FailedInspection.svg\\' alt=\\'FailedInspection\\' />.  POMDPs also include <img className=\\'latex-svg\\' src=\\'http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/O.svg\\' alt=\\'O\\' />, the observation function.  The observation function takes as input, a particular state, action, and observation, and returns the probability of this combination.  Put simply, if you happen to be in state <img className=\\'latex-svg\\' src=\\'http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/s.svg\\' alt=\\'s\\' /> and you do action <img className=\\'latex-svg\\' src=\\'http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/a.svg\\' alt=\\'a\\' />, what are the odds you will observe <img className=\\'latex-svg\\' src=\\'http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/o.svg\\' alt=\\'o\\' />.  If your house happens to be infested with termites, and you hire an inspector, what is the probability they will find the infestation?  By the table above, 98%.  Defining the observation function more formally, you get <img className=\\'latex-svg\\' src=\\'http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/O+%253A+S%2C+A%2C+%5C%5COmega%2C+%5C%5Crightarrow+%5B0%2C1%5D.svg\\' alt=\\'O : S, A, \\\\Omega, \\\\rightarrow [0,1]\\' />.</p>\\n<p>The observation function captures imperfections in the sensors available to an agent.  Those sensors can be something as simple as the card you\\'ve got in your hand or as complex as all our visual and auditory senses.</p>\\n<p>In order to do anything useful with a POMDP, you have to <em>know</em> this function.  In other words, for a home buyer to use a POMDP to do optimal decision making, they would need to know the reliability of the inspector as shown in the table above.  Although this is a criticism highlighting the limits of the formalism\\'s robustness, this limitation still permits a vast set of interesting problems where POMDPs are applicable.  Further, the methodology could perhaps be extended to learn this function.</p>\\n<p>So we now add <img className=\\'latex-svg\\' src=\\'http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/O.svg\\' alt=\\'O\\' /> and <img className=\\'latex-svg\\' src=\\'http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/%5C%5COmega.svg\\' alt=\\'\\\\Omega\\' /> to the tuple giving us the formal definition of a POMDP:</p>\\n<p><img className=\\'latex-svg\\' src=\\'http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/%5C%5Cbig+%5C%5Clangle+S%2C+A%2C+T%2C+R%2C+%5C%5COmega%2C+O%2C+%5C%5Cdelta+%5C%5Cbig+%5C%5Crangle.svg\\' alt=\\'\\\\big \\\\langle S, A, T, R, \\\\Omega, O, \\\\delta \\\\big \\\\rangle\\' /></p>\\n<p>I snuck in an extra variable called <img className=\\'latex-svg\\' src=\\'http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/%5C%5Cdelta.svg\\' alt=\\'\\\\delta\\' />.  This is the discount factor.  It should also be there in the MDP definition, but our previous episode and blog entry left it out for simplicity.  This is a value in the range <img className=\\'latex-svg\\' src=\\'http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/%5B0%2C+1%5D.svg\\' alt=\\'[0, 1]\\' /> which specifies how to value further expected rewards.  In other words, a dollar today is better than a dollar tomorrow.  But is it better than a two dollars tomorrow?  Probably not.  What\\'s the minimum tomorrow value to be worth waiting for?  Depends on your discount factor <img className=\\'latex-svg\\' src=\\'http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/%5C%5Cdelta.svg\\' alt=\\'\\\\delta\\' />.</p>\\n<p>We need to generalize our definition of the transition function <img className=\\'latex-svg\\' src=\\'http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/T.svg\\' alt=\\'T\\' /> from the original MDP definition.  In that definition, we had a probability distribution over the next state based on the current state.  The observation that we will get in the partially observable world is going to inform this function.  The POMDP definition is <img className=\\'latex-svg\\' src=\\'http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/T%253A+S_t%2C+A_t%2C+O_t%2C+S_%7Bt%252B1%7D+%5C%5Crightarrow+%5B0%2C+1%5D.svg\\' alt=\\'T: S_t, A_t, O_t, S_{t+1} \\\\rightarrow [0, 1]\\' />.  In the vernacular: given a particular state, action taken in that state, and observation made while taking that action (all this at time <img className=\\'latex-svg\\' src=\\'http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/t.svg\\' alt=\\'t\\' />), what\\'s the probability of going into a particular next state (at <img className=\\'latex-svg\\' src=\\'http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/t%252B1.svg\\' alt=\\'t+1\\' />)?</p>\\n<p>This tuple is the definition of the POMDP.  It\\'s nice in that it provides a formal, well defined framework which can be used to describe a wide variety of problems in a common language.  Just about any situation you can think of can be expressed in the form of a POMDP.  Although it\\'s not done much, nothing is stopping us from using this idea to analyze the differences and properties of stochastic games in a manner analogous to the way a computational theorist studies the properties of classes of algorithms.  Yet, POMDPs are not widely thought of as abstract tools in this way.  There mostly thought of as <em>tools</em> for solving problems.</p>\\n<p>The algorithms for solving POMDPs are known.  Implementations like <a href=\"http://www.pomdp.org/code/index.html\">pomdp-solve</a> exist.  If you can specify your problem in the form of a POMDP and provide it as input to that program, it will return you an <em>optimal</em> solution to your problem!  No programming required.  Just provide some JSON file like this:</p>\\n<p><code><pre>\\n{\\n    \"S\": {\"TERMITES\", \"NO_TERMITES\"},\\n    \"A\": {\"BUY\", \"NO_BUY\"},\\n    \"T\": [...],\\n    \"R\": [...],\\n    \"Omega\": {\"PASS_INSPECTION\", \"FAIL_INSPECTION\"},\\n    \"O\": [...],\\n    \"delta\": 0.752\\n}\\n</pre></code></p>\\n<p>... and that\\'s all there is to it.  Just state your problem, submit it to <code>pomdp-solve</code> and wait.  And wait.  And wait and wait and wait and wait and wait.  Because solving this problem suffers from the <a href=\"https://dataskeptic.com/blog/episodes/2015/the-curse-of-dimensionality\">curse of dimensionality</a>.</p>\\n<p>If we ignore intractability for the moment, we can be certain of finding the optimal behavior to adopt under any circumstance.  When you \"solve\" a POMDP, the result is a policy.  The policy is a finite state machine.  Think about that for a moment, because it\\'s rather remarkable.  A finite state machine has no memory.  It\\'s a rather \"dumb\" thing.  Following the instructions of a finite state machine is a rather mindless behavior.  Yet it\\'s optimal.  Using it is computationally efficient.  There would be no surprises running it in some production system.  Memory needs and computational needs would be trivial to estimate.  If some useful system was managed by a POMDP, that system could be very easily maintained and verified.  This would be ideal for critical systems which simply <em>cannot</em> fail.</p>\\n<p>So the policy that one gets by solving a POMDP comes in a very nice form.  How do we arrive at it?  I won\\'t cover this fully here.  If you\\'re eager to go down this exciting rabbithole, the core answer is using the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman_equation\">Bellman equation</a>.  The best place to go next is <a href=\"http://www.pomdp.org/\">The POMDP Page</a>.  Everybody, get over there.  That site should be Alexa Top 50.  A wealth of good information on POMDPs available for you.</p>',\n",

If you\\'re looking for a bit more on this subject, a great next step is <a href=\"http://www.cassandra.org/arc/talks/aaai2013/index.html\">these slides</a> from Anthony Cassandra.</p>\\n<p>There are 20 slides that present some of the core ideas of POMDPs visually, helping to teach the methods a bit better than our audio format podcast would allow.  A great follow up after these sides would be either the original paper or the applicable chapter in Russell and Norvig\\'s textbook.</p>\\n<p>We took two images from the presentation to create this post\\'s featured image.  There are two parts.</p>\\n<p>The \"flow chart\" is the policy of a solved POMDP.  Specifically, it\\'s the optimal strategy which was discussed on the podcast and summarized as the \"two consistent listens means open\" strategy.  The second image in especially key to understanding how POMDPs are solved, so let\\'s go deeper into an explanation of that image.</p>\\n<p>We first observe our axis and find the x-axis labeled \"Belief State\".  Since there are two states in the Lady and the Tiger Game, <img className=\\'latex-svg\\' src=\\'http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/TigerLeft.svg\\' alt=\\'TigerLeft\\' /> and <img className=\\'latex-svg\\' src=\\'http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/TigerRight.svg\\' alt=\\'TigerRight\\' />, we can summarize our believes with one number: <img className=\\'latex-svg\\' src=\\'http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/Pr%28TigerLeft%29.svg\\' alt=\\'Pr(TigerLeft)\\' /> since <img className=\\'latex-svg\\' src=\\'http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/Pr%28TigerRight%29+%253D+1+-+Pr%28TigerLeft%29.svg\\' alt=\\'Pr(TigerRight) = 1 - Pr(TigerLeft)\\' />.  The visualization we have here <em>only</em> works for simple one-parameter believe spaces.</p>\\n<p>This representation can be generalized to any number of dimensions, depending on the state.  While it\\'s often insightful to view 3D plots for this sort of representation, most non-trivia problems exist in <img className=\\'latex-svg\\' src=\\'http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/n.svg\\' alt=\\'n\\' /> dimensional state spaces with <img className=\\'latex-svg\\' src=\\'http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/n+%253E+3.svg\\' alt=\\'n > 3\\' />, so visualization of the entire belief space is impossible.  Yet, in this simple example, it\\'s quite instructive.</p>\\n<p>In the game described by the plot, the agent has four Actions available to choose from: <img className=\\'latex-svg\\' src=\\'http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/R.svg\\' alt=\\'R\\' />, <img className=\\'latex-svg\\' src=\\'http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/S.svg\\' alt=\\'S\\' />, <img className=\\'latex-svg\\' src=\\'http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/T.svg\\' alt=\\'T\\' />, and <img className=\\'latex-svg\\' src=\\'http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/N.svg\\' alt=\\'N\\' />.  Of course, the can execute any action at any time.  However, a rational agent should reason in the following way: <em>if</em> my beliefs were <img className=\\'latex-svg\\' src=\\'http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/x.svg\\' alt=\\'x\\' />, what would be the expected value I could earn if I executed action <img className=\\'latex-svg\\' src=\\'http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/a_i.svg\\' alt=\\'a_i\\' />.  For example, in the Lady and the Tiger game, a super high degree of belief that the tiger is on the left should intuitively cause the agent to open the opposite door.  By extension, as the belief that the tiger is on the left, at some point, it must become more optimal to take the action of listening.  By further extension, there must be some point at which the agent has become confident enough that the tiger is on the right, and thus, opening the opposite door becomes the best option.</p>\\n<p>Thus, the four lines shown in this plot represent the expected value an agent can earn given their belief state.  Technically, these lines exist over the entire domain from 0 to 1.  However, for brevity / clarity, the creator of this image has trimmed these lines to primarily show the area in which each action is optimal.</p>\\n<p>The optimal action an agent can take is thus given by the maximizing action given their beliefs.  Should their beliefs fall exactly at the intersection of two links, this indicates a complete ambivalence for either strategy, best settled by a coin toss.  Thus, the maximizing line at each point constitutes the value function of the agent.</p>\\n<p>Such a function is labeled \"piecewise linear an convex\".  It\\'s piecewise because of the discontinuities where an agent switches what action they should take.  It\\'s linear because each piece is linear.  It\\'s convex because the optimal piecewise segments meet the mathematical definition of convex.  The properties of convexity can be exploited in these problems.</p>\\n<p>If you\\'re interested in learning more, check out the aforementioned slides:</p>\\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cassandra.org/arc/talks/aaai2013/index.html\">http://www.cassandra.org/arc/talks/aaai2013/index.html</a></p>',\n",

       "     'description': '<p>About VigLink:</p>\\n\\n<p>At VigLink, we believe the future of marketing lies within the untapped potential of digital content covering commercial products across the Web. We empower influential publishers who produce this content to connect enthusiastic consumers with the products they love from the brands who value them the most. We accomplish this directly through publishers’ words, without need for an ad.</p>\\n\\n<p>By identifying commercial products mentioned within a publisher’s content, VigLink automatically invigorates those terms by transforming them into hyperlinks whose destinations are determined in real-time, advertiser-bid auctions. Yes, hyperlinks, the defining feature of the Web from the very start. The literal “H” in HTML. Every time a clicked link takes a person from one destination to another, value is created. However, that value has never been fairly priced or available for purchase at scale. Until now.</p>\\n\\n<p>Founded in 2009, VigLink is located in heart of San Francisco and backed by top investors including Google Ventures, Emergence Capital, and RRE. VigLink manages a publisher network of over 2 million sites and apps, as well as an advertiser network of over 70,000 brands and merchants.</p>\\n\\n<p>About the role:</p>\\n\\n<p>VigLink is seeking a Data Scientist or Machine Learning Engineer with strong Hadoop, Hive and SQL skills, and experience creating production-quality code in Python, R, or other related languages. We are looking for folks who enjoy working on a variety of different types of analyses, ranging from ad-hoc \"data wrangling\" tasks through the creation of full-blown programs to calculate business-critical, customer-visible values on an ongoing basis, enjoy thinking through a data problem, understanding the customer needs associated with it, and working on your own and with other developers to create a pragmatic solution.</p>\\n\\n<p>At VigLink we love go-getters and people who like working in an Agile, best-practices environment - who understand the importance of testable, modular, efficient code, so that\\'s what you write.</p>\\n\\n<p>Required Qualifications:</p>\\n\\n<p>Minimum of 3 years experience in relevant analytics tasks with strong Python, R, Matlab, or related language<br>\\nExperience training and implementing supervised and/or unsupervised learning models\\u2002<br>\\nSolid understanding of databases and SQL<br>\\nCapacious curiosity for data and algorithms, and how to apply them to create insight<br>\\nExperience with Linux/Unix—you are comfortable on the command line<br>\\nExperience in the e-commerce, web analytics, search, and cloud computing space<br>\\nBA/BS degree in Computer Science preferred with a strong academic record (MS/PhD or equivalent a plus)</p>\\n\\n<p>Preferred Qualifications:</p>\\n\\n<p>NLP experience particularly with concepts such as document classification, named entity recognition/disambiguation, and topic modelling<br>\\nExperience with Java, or a JVM based language like Scala<br>\\nExperience with the Hadoop ecosystem, particularly Pig and Hive</p>\\n\\n<p>A few fun problems we\\'re working on:</p>\\n\\n<p>Feature Extraction and Context / Product Inference\\nIdentify the commercial context of publisher content, identify the relevance of commercial links to that content, and match relevant destinations to appropriate products / services available across the web.</p>\\n\\n<p>Statistical Modeling and Prediction of Earnings\\nModel the performance of our existing publishers and merchants to predict future performance at high granularity.</p>\\n\\n<p>Large-Data Analytics and Audience Profiling\\nDevelop automated insights that help publishers improve their performance by developing a better understanding of their audiences based on billions of impressions and tens of millions of clicks per week.

Every day, we have new problems to solve and new theories to test. Our entrepreneurial culture is driven by our talented team of traders and programmers. At Jane Street, we don\\'t come to work wanting to leave. We come to work excited to test new theories, have thought-provoking discussions, and maybe sneak in a game of ping-pong or two. Keeping our culture casual and our employees happy is of paramount importance to us.</p>\\n\\n<p>We are looking to hire great software developers with an interest in functional programming. OCaml, a statically typed functional programming language with similarities to Haskell, Scheme, Erlang, F# and SML, is our language of choice. We\\'ve got the largest team of OCaml developers in any industrial setting, and probably the world\\'s largest OCaml codebase. We use OCaml for running our entire business, supporting everything from research to systems administration to trading systems. If you\\'re interested in seeing how functional programming plays out in the real world, there\\'s no better place.</p>\\n\\n<p>The atmosphere is informal and intellectual. There is a focus on education, and people learn about software and trading, both through formal classes and on the job. The work is challenging, and you get to see the practical impact of your efforts in quick and dramatic terms. Jane Street is also small enough that people have the freedom to get involved in many different areas of the business. Compensation is highly competitive, and there\\'s a lot of room for growth.</p>\\n\\n<p>You can learn more about Jane Street and our technology from our main site, janestreet.com. You can also look at a a talk given at CMU about why Jane Street uses functional programming (<a href=\"http://ocaml.janestreet.com/?q=node/61\">http://ocaml.janestreet.com/?q=node/61</a>), and our programming blog (<a href=\"http://ocaml.janestreet.com\">http://ocaml.janestreet.com</a>).</p>\\n\\n<p>We also have extensive benefits, including:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>90% book reimbursement for work-related books</li>\\n<li>90% tuition reimbursement for continuing education</li>\\n<li>Excellent, zero-premium medical and dental insurance</li>\\n<li>Free lunch delivered daily from a selection of restaurants</li>\\n<li>Catered breakfasts and fresh brewed Peet\\'s coffee</li>\\n<li>An on-site, private gym in New York with towel service</li>\\n<li>Kitchens fully stocked with a variety of snack choices</li>\\n<li>Full company 401(k) match up to 6% of salary, vests immediately</li>\\n</ul><p>More information at <a href=\"http://janestreet.com/culture/benefits/\">http://janestreet.com/culture/benefits/</a></p>',\n",

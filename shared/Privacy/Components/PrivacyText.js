      Our mailing list is managed through Mailchimp. Although we may include
      advertisements in our correspondence from time to time, nothing except
      default Mailchimp tracking occurs and we never sell or expose email
      addresses to anyone ever.

      We track audio player usage on our site. If you listen to the podcast at
      dataskeptic.com, we monitor pausing, skipping ahead, etc. This is done
      using an anonymous ID which is not linked anywhere else. Our objective
      here is to measure the way people listen to the show. Do they skip ahead?
      Do they drop off?
